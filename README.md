# CodeLouisvilleProject
Website I'm building for my CodeLouisville Project

I built this site as a requirement for the CodeLouisville Front End Web Development class. As an added benefit, the site will also serve as the base for a good friend's new woodworking business.

There are plans for the site to go live in the future. In the meantime, you can launch the site by opening the index.html.
