# CodeLouisvilleProject
Website I'm building for my CodeLouisville Project

I built this site as a requirement for the CodeLouisville Front End Web Development class. As an added benefit, the site will also serve as the base for a good friend's new woodworking business.

There are plans for the site to go live in the future. In the meantime, you can launch the site by downloading the project and opening the index.html.
